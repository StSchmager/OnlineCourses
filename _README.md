# Online Courses (MOOCs)
In terms of __data-science, analytics, and statistics__ I have taken MOOCs (massive open online classes) at __edX, Udacity, and Coursera__.
The latter offers an excellent series of classes I've been taking: the __Coursera data science specialization provided by the Johns Hokpins University' School of Public Health__.
Udacity and edX have helped me to refresh on basic statistics at the very beginning of my online class career, although I intend to take more of their classes, e.g. __Data Analyst Nanodegree Program by Udacity__.

Each folder in this repository contains my coursework and certificates of accomplishment from the respective institutions.
