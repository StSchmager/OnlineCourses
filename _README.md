# Online Courses (MOOCs)
In terms of __data-science, analytics, and statistics__ I have taken MOOCs (massive open online classes) at _edX, Udacity, and Coursera_.
The latter offers an excellent series of classes I've been taking: the __Coursera data science specialization__ provided by the Johns Hokpins University' School of Public Health.
Udacity and edX have helped me to refresh on basic statistics at the very beginning of my online class career, although I intend to take more of their classes, e.g. __Data Analyst Nanodegree Program__ by _Udacity_.

Each folder in this repository contains my coursework and certificates of accomplishment from the respective institutions.
