# Online Courses (MOOCs)
In terms of __data-science, analytics, and statistics__ I have taken MOOCs (massive open online classes) at _edX, Udacity, and Coursera_.
The latter offers an excellent series of classes I've been taking: the __Coursera data science specialization__ provided by the Johns Hokpins University' School of Public Health.
Udacity and edX have helped me to refresh on basic statistics at the very beginning of my online class career, although I intend to take more of their classes, e.g. __Data Analyst Nanodegree Program__ by _Udacity_.

Each folder in this repository contains my coursework and certificates of accomplishment from the respective institutions.

## Coursera Data-Science Specialization by Johns Hopkins University - School of Public Health

Taught by the amazing biostatistics professor trio of [Roger Peng](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/rdpeng), [Brian Caffo](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/~47), and [Jeff Leek](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/~315), I have completed the courses:

1. The Data Scientistâ€™s Toolbox
2. R Programming
3. Getting and Cleaning Data
4. Exploratory Data Analysis
5. Reproducible Research
6. Statistical Inference
7. Regression Models

For all classes, I compiled my coursework in the sub-repositories.
However, for some classes, certificates of accomplishments were not issues due to Coursera's evolving pay model. The first classes concluded with a complimentary certificate. When I completed Reproducible Research, for instance, Coursera switched to paid certificates; although I completed the whole course, I didn't get a certificate. The latest class, Regression Models, was concluded with a certificate that was paid for.

Starting in the fall 2016, I intend to wrap up the series by completing the final courses:

* Practical Machine Learning
* Developing Data Products
* Data Science Capstone

## Udacity

Taught by Udacity founder and Stanford professor, I took the primer class of [Intro to Statistics: Making Decisions Based on Data](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-statistics--st101). All coursework was submitted interactively in the video lecture sessions, so that I couldn't record any kind of programming scripts or project write-ups.

## edX

Taught by Berkley statistics professors, I took another primer class: [Introduction to Descriptive Statistics](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-statistics-descriptive-uc-berkeleyx-stat2-1x).  All coursework was submitted interactively in the video lecture sessions, so that I couldn't record any kind of programming scripts or project write-ups.
