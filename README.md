# Online Courses
As a curious, dedicated, and passionate individual; lifelong learning is an important part of my life/career. Online platforms like Coursera, Udacity, edX, Khan Academy, etc. provide amazing MOOCs that help me become better at what I love to do: data science and analytics. Here is the coursework that I have accomplished thus far.

In terms of data-science, analytics, and statistics I have taken MOOCs (massive open online classes) at edX, Udacity, and Coursera.
The latter offers an excellent series of classes I've been taking: the Coursera data science specialization provided by the Johns Hokpins University' School of Public Health.
Udacity and edX have helped me to refresh on basic statistics at the very beginning of my online class career, although I intend to take more of their classes, e.g. Data Analyst Nanodegree Program.
